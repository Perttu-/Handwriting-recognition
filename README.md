# Handwriting recognition
Matlab implementation with image processing toolbox.
Preprocessing and layout analysis.
Includes test and result images. Also some seminar presentations and related stuff.
Some test images are taken from IAM handwriting database.

####Preprocessing:
- Adaptive Wiener filtering
- Binarization with Sauvola algorithm
- (Skew correction?)
- Stroke width analysis

####Layout Analysis:
- Bounding box expansion to find areas of interest
- Rlsa(run length smearing algorithm) for row and word detection
TODO: Implement row detection that works with overlapping lines.
